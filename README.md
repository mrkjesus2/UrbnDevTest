# Instructions

In order to work with the project locally:

- Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:mrkjesus2/UrbnDevTest.git`
- `cd` into the cloned directory

You can use your own server to host the 'src' directory. Alternatively, if you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed, you can:

- Run `npm install` in the project directory
- Run `gulp serve` to host the site at 'localhost:8000'

In the event that you want to change any of the LESS in the project, you will need
to get the bootstrap source files.

- If you have bower installed this is as easy as `bower install bootstrap` in the project directory
- Otherwise you will have to run `npm -g install bower` beforehand
